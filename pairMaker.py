# The purpose of this python app is to detect the correct amount of servers that are in a group.
# I know that there is a minimum of 2 (so a pair). but there is a need to generate up to the max.
# to aid in running jobs. 
# Example the "appServerXY01" and "appServerXY03" come in as unhealthy, but we might need to check all of them in the group. 
# We know that there is typically an even number of servers in the group. so we generate the text of 01-04 in this instance.
